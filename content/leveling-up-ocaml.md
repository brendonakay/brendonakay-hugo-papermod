# Advent of Code

I thought I'd level up my skills with OCaml by practicing last
year's Advent of Code puzzles.

To learn idiomatic OCaml I am referencing a public repo https://github.com/EvgenyPetrovsky/aoc2022_ocaml
I am going through and adding comments in areas to further clarify my
understanding.

My goal is to only use day 1 as a reference and work on the rest of the days
myself.

I also want to build a module that optionally retrieves the day's input. Maybe
optionally store it in an input folder? Functional programming makes this an
easy task since the types are static. I know where to "plug in" my module.

This will also be a lesson in Functors and Modules.
